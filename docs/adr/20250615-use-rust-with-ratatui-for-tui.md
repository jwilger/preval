## Context and Problem Statement

PrEval needs to provide a rich terminal user interface (TUI) that works across different platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) while handling concurrent process management and real-time updates. What technology stack should we use for implementation?

## Decision Drivers

- Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Performance for real-time UI updates
- Strong concurrency support for multiple evaluators
- Memory safety and reliability
- Rich TUI capabilities
- Active ecosystem and community

## Considered Options

1. Python with Rich/Textual
2. Go with Bubble Tea
3. Rust with Ratatui
4. Node.js with Blessed

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Rust with Ratatui", because it provides the best combination of performance, safety, and cross-platform support. Rust's ownership system prevents common concurrency bugs, while Ratatui provides a powerful TUI framework.

### Positive Consequences

- Memory safety without garbage collection
- Excellent performance for real-time updates
- Strong type system catches errors at compile time
- Native binary distribution (no runtime required)
- Ratatui provides rich TUI widgets and layouts
- Tokio integration for async process management

### Negative Consequences

- Steeper learning curve than Python or JavaScript
- Longer compilation times during development
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Python/Node.js

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Python with Rich/Textual

Python TUI frameworks with rich widget support.

- Good, because easy to develop and iterate
- Good, because Rich/Textual have beautiful defaults
- Good, because large ecosystem
- Bad, because slower performance
- Bad, because GIL limits true concurrency
- Bad, because requires Python runtime

### Go with Bubble Tea

Go-based TUI framework inspired by Elm architecture.

- Good, because good performance
- Good, because built-in concurrency
- Good, because single binary distribution
- Bad, because less mature TUI ecosystem
- Bad, because error handling is verbose
- Bad, because no memory safety guarantees

### Rust with Ratatui

Rust TUI framework with immediate mode rendering.

- Good, because excellent performance
- Good, because memory safety guarantees
- Good, because no runtime dependencies
- Good, because rich widget library
- Good, because great async story with Tokio
- Bad, because steeper learning curve
- Bad, because longer compile times

### Node.js with Blessed

JavaScript TUI framework with React-like API.

- Good, because familiar to many developers
- Good, because quick iteration
- Good, because npm ecosystem
- Bad, because requires Node.js runtime
- Bad, because performance limitations
- Bad, because memory usage concerns
