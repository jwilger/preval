## Context and Problem Statement

PrEval has an ambitious vision with many features. We need a development approach that delivers value quickly while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on user feedback and changing requirements.

## Decision Drivers

- Need to validate core concepts early
- Limited initial resources
- Uncertain about all user requirements
- Desire for quick feedback cycles
- Risk of over-engineering

## Considered Options

1. Big bang: implement all features before release
2. Agile MVP: incremental development with early releases
3. Feature-complete prototype first
4. Research spike followed by full implementation

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Agile MVP: incremental development with early releases", because it allows us to validate assumptions early and adapt based on real usage.

### Positive Consequences

- Usable tool available quickly
- Early user feedback shapes development
- Reduced risk of building wrong features
- Flexible to change direction
- Maintains development momentum

### Negative Consequences

- Initial versions have limited features
- May require refactoring as we learn
- Need to manage user expectations

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Test Mode Only)
- Single evaluator support
- Test suite mode only
- Basic OpenTelemetry parsing
- Simple progress display
- JSON/HTML reports

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
- Comparison with previous runs
- Interactive exploration
- Configuration files

### Phase 3: Multi-Evaluator
- Concurrent evaluator support
- Aggregate metrics
- Test suite management

### Phase 4: Advanced Modes
- Online collection mode
- Continuous monitoring
- Advanced export formats
