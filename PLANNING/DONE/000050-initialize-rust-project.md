# Initialize Rust Project with Dependencies

## User Story
As a developer, I want to set up the initial Rust project structure with all necessary dependencies so that I can begin implementing PrEval features.

## Business Value
- Establishes foundation for all future development
- Ensures consistent development environment
- Enables immediate progress on core features

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create Cargo.toml with initial dependencies:
  - [x] ratatui for TUI framework
  - [x] crossterm for terminal handling
  - [x] tokio with full features for async runtime
  - [x] serde and serde_json for JSON parsing
  - [x] clap for CLI argument parsing
  - [x] anyhow and thiserror for error handling
  - [x] tracing and tracing-subscriber for logging
  - [x] dirs for cross-platform directory handling
- [x] Create basic project structure following architecture:
  - [x] src/main.rs with CLI parsing
  - [x] src/app.rs for application state
  - [x] src/ui/mod.rs for UI components
  - [x] src/evaluator/mod.rs for process management
  - [x] src/protocol/mod.rs for handshake and OpenTelemetry parsing
- [x] Implement minimal CLI that accepts evaluator command
- [x] Add basic error handling and logging setup
- [x] Ensure project builds and runs (shows help message)

## Technical Notes
- Use workspace structure to support future expansion
- Set up proper module organization from the start
- Configure clippy and fmt rules in Cargo.toml
- Add basic tracing subscriber for debugging

## Definition of Done
- [x] Project builds with `cargo build`
- [x] All tests pass with `cargo test`
- [x] Code passes `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
- [x] Can run `cargo run -- --help` and see usage information
